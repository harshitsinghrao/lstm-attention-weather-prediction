# lstm-attention-weather-prediction
Here, we do weather prediction using LSTM and Attention. The dataset contains 14 different features such as atmospheric pressure, humidity, temperature, etc. Our goal is to predict the future temperature using all these 14 features. 

## Dataset
Steps to use the dataset.
- Click this [link](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/jena_climate_2009_2016.csv.zip) to download the dataset.
- Extract the zip file. 
- Place the contents inside the extracted folder into the main repository. 

## Instructions
After preparing the dataset, train the neural network:
```
python main.py
```
